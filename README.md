# LeNet Implementation (Python)

## STILL UNDER WORK ##

An OOP implementation of the LeNet CNN architecture. 
I made this to further build upon the basics I learned after working through the book *Make Your Own Neural Network* by Tariq Rashid.
I decided to go for a more "vanilla" implementation to get a better understanding of what is happening "under the hood".

Libraries used:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (1.19.3)
