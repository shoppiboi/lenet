# LeNet Implementation (Python)

**STILL WORK IN PROGRESS. Currently trying to implement backpropagation with the convolutional layers**

An OOP implementation of the LeNet CNN architecture. 
I made this to further build upon the basics I learned after working through the book *Make Your Own Neural Network* by Tariq Rashid.
I decided against using any pre-made machine-learning libraries and to start from "scratch" to grasp a better understanding of what is happening "under the hood". 


Libraries used:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (1.19.3)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (3.3.3)

Resources used:
* [*Make Your Own Neural Network*, Tariq Rashid](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G)
* [*CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks For Visual Recognition*, Stanford](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)
