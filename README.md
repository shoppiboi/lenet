# LeNet Implementation (Python)

## STILL UNDER WORK ##

An OOP implementation of the LeNet CNN architecture. 
I made this to further build upon the basics I learned after working through the book *Make Your Own Neural Network* by Tariq Rashid.
I decided against using any pre-made machine-learning libraries and to start from "scratch" to grasp a better understanding of what is happening "under the hood". 


Libraries used:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (1.19.3)

Resources used:
* [*Make Your Own Neural Network*, Tariq Rashid](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G)
* [*CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks For Visual Recognition*, Stanford](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)
* [*Back Propagation in Convolutional Neural Networks*, Jefkine](https://www.jefkine.com/general/2016/09/05/backpropagation-in-convolutional-neural-networks/)
